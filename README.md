# Project Name: Neural Model Comparison

## Overview
This project compares two neural models: S4 and LRU, evaluating their performance across accuracy. We compare in task Key-Word Spotting. Audio is a long time-series format and good fit for this models.


## Introduction
Neural models play a crucial role in various applications, and understanding their performance characteristics is essential for making informed decisions. This project focuses on comparing two neural models, S4 and LRU, to help users choose the most suitable model for their specific needs.

## Models

### S4
S4 is a neural model designed for [provide brief description]. It excels in [mention specific strengths] but may have limitations in [highlight potential weaknesses].

### LRU
LRU, on the other hand, is a neural model with a different architecture, tailored for [provide brief description]. It stands out in [highlight specific strengths] but may face challenges in [mention potential weaknesses].
